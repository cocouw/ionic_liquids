# ILthermo database
The ILthermo database from NIST has 1461 ionic liquids, 2967 compounds and  9950 binary mixture system, which is sufficient for machine learning.
A subset are collected here in the datasets folder.
Molecular descriptors will be generated "on the fly" from the SMILES strings by RDkit.
This is important for easy use of the model to incorporate or predict new compounds.
