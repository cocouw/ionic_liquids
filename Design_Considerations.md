# Main Idea
The main idea of this project is to design a machine learning framework to take some easily-measured properties of the ionic liquid to predict some non-trivial properties.

# Use Cases
This package aims to help researchers choose potential
binary systems of ionic liquids by predicting desired properties
of the resulting mixture.

## Electrical Conductivity Prediction
The electrical conductivity is a non-trivial property for measurement. However, it is of the great importance in the application of flow battery.
In this project, we will use some simple properties, e.g. density, dielectric constant, ratio of the binary component to output the electrical conductivity.
