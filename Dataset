ILthermo database
It has 1461 ionic liquids, 2967 compounds and  9950 binary mixture system, which is sufficient for machine learning. Data are collected from 2452 reference and are well archived and organized by NIST.
Multiple properties can be found in the dataset including viscosity(~30000 data points), density(~180000 data points), heat capacity etc.
Descriptors will be generated by RDkit. The dimension of descriptors varies from 100 to 300 depends on the descriptor generator we use.
1/10 of the data can be spared for testing and validation.
